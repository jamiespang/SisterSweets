Sister Sweets Cookies is a website I created for a fictitious Cookie shop. I chose this website idea because my sister and I started baking and decorating cookies during the Covid-19 pandemic. We actually bake and decorate cookies for family parties and celebrations, but we have not mastered all of the cookie complexities or icing consistencies to start a business just yet.
